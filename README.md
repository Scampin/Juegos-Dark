# Juegos-Dark
A website that I designed entirely on my own for the Web Design final exam in 2nd year computer science.
I'm still proud of the result, despite how poorly compiled it is.

The site was intended to be a tribute to video games in flash (.swf). Several colleagues told me at the time that it was the best project that was delivered.
Besides, it was a group work (2 or 3 people) and I did it all by myself, applying the little knowledge I had of HTML/CSS at the time and my 8 years of experience
using graphic design programs like Photoshop.
